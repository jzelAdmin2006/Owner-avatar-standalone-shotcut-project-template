# Standalone Shotcut project template

Want to send someone a Shotcut project but think they are too lazy to install Shotcut? No problem! Just send them a standalone project that works on any Windows computer.

This is created based on https://github.com/jzelAdmin2006/standalone-shotcut-project-template-old which has had issues regarding warnings by Windows Defender and less flexibility because 7z and Shotcut were inside the repository.
